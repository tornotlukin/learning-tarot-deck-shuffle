# learning-tarot-deck-shuffle
A tarot deck shuffler and dealer. It will shuffle the deck and deal out the cards in a Celtic Cross Spread. It shuffles the items in the deck array using a Fisher–Yates randomizer and deals out the first ten cards to each position in the tableau. There is a ten percent chance that the card gets inverted in the shuffle (which is important to some tarot readings). Inverted cards will be shown rotated 180° in the tableau. This was my second attempt at Javascript, iterating on my first.
